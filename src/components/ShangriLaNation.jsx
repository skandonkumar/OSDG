Artist. Poet. Man. Who are we? Why are we here? Where are we going? Is there truth in our vision? How in the hell do I know the answer to those questions? I do not. Buddha sent me, of that I am sure - just like you. Let's get on with it. This wasn't my idea, but at this point, does that really matter?</p>

Maybe that name doesn't appear anywhere on the premises, but it does in the mind and in the heart. In memories of the heart is where all truth resides. So be it. Here we are. Nice place, hunh?</p>

Buddha wakes me. Rushing air out of the refrigerator serving as a vent for the a/c, it so chilling cold that sleep is impossible - unless you are dreaming; dreaming of icefishing in Alaska, maybe. I'm not; I wasn't. Three shirts, sipping good strong coffee that my young friend gifted. Other side of the wall, under morning star, a three a.m. warrior prepares for the brigade of the buck. Starbuck. He ain't goin' nowhere there - except maybe out the door for speaking his mind. Speaking a mind - that'll get you in trouble in this world. Do me a favor. More on our young Starbuck, later. Yea, he'll tell you himself he's worth a whole book, maybe two. He's not. Not yet. </p>

You are anyway. But I'll be quiet if you will. </p>

Who knows these things. What is peace, anyway? Rosa. Then, seventeen; I imagine her stunning beauty and bubbly, estrogenic confidence brought her to Shangri-La in the first place. The first place: Wow. The ‘60's.        El Swinging Sixties. Now in Shangri-La, four-thirty in the morning, a woman black as smoke stands at my door. Head-dress, Southern shanty woman, peering in, she stares. Startled, I ask Buddha, is this the Muse? She vanishes as quickly as she came.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>Ever so carefully, Rosa tries to turn in her bed. She is unable to move. In the Sixties, life was sweet. That's right. Teen beauty, German accent, full breasts, a smile to die for. That'll take a girl far. It took Rosa right to here, to us. She came; she saw; she ignited. Men were men. Good for nothing fucks. Always interested in the same things:   Money. Sex. Power. Good for us. Ain't changed ever. Won't. Sad. It’s all so sad.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>Rosa can't move too good. She can dream and she does. Like I told you, she was young and she came to Shangri-La looking for what women look for before they look for what they really need. Rosa was looking for what she wanted.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>Conti was a young, good-looking Italian Jew. Like most Wops, you would have made him for a Catholic; you would have been wrong. Amongst the Tribe, Conti wore his Jewness like a gold pinky ring. Classy. Twenty-five, Conti was a salesman. At heart, like all good Americans, one way or another they were all salesmen. You buyin’? Pity.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>Conti fronted dresses. Nice smooth silks. High-line stylish like you'd find in Neiman's ¬prêt-a-porter if you could spell it; better, if you knew what it meant. Conti. Slender young sophisticate; lizard loafers, roomy Italian slacks, thick black hair and radiant olive skin. Conti had money in his clip, a hard dick, and no conscience. Just what Rosa was looking for. Rosa had no idea how good she was going to look in Conti's dresses. </p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>Sitting at the unshaded bus stop in front of Conti's apartment window, five o'clock, Rosa was thinking only of returning to what for her was a miserably retarded life at Ursuline Academy girl's school. No boy friend, only a weekly violin lesson that got her out of her dorm room, off the campus, onto the bus, unknowingly emitting sensual radium here at the gates of Shangri-La. After playing Mendelssohn's A Minor Sonata for the seventeenth time in three months, she waited. At his window, Conti felt a stir. Rising, Rosa felt it too but did not see.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>Conti was a good man. Then again, made by the gods, we are all good men. Good. From a port in Miami his Neapolitan father captained an ocean liner, regularly visiting South America. Mother bearing children and pasta, occasionally served with fresh melon and ciabatta breads, she lived in Naples, as for hundreds and hundreds of years did all the members of their family. That wouldn't last, but, then again, nothing does. Conti sat by the window marking on his daily racing form. What fucking good is a daily racing form if there are no horse races in Texas? What is it with these Baptists? Allez! Perhaps no Hialeah, pero, we must have somewhere to admire and bet ponies! Looking up, Conti's pencil point was sharp. Pink marble virgin struck a pose. Rosa. School girl plaid skirt, thigh, black and white saddle oxfords. Not bad. Not bad at all.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>Conti suddenly needed a newspaper. What man wouldn't? Out the apartment door onto the balcony overlooking the gorgeous garden and turquoise pool; turn left, down the stairs to the sidewalk; past the finely trimmed green grass, just a few more steps. The Dallas Times Herald. Ten cents. Better than the Morning News - although crafty Paul Crume was a smoking piker waiting on his time in the sky so that finally, without fear of recrimination, Crume could laugh his ass off at Dallas' conservative silliness. Conti reached into the lined pocket of his trousers avoiding the manly impediment.   He withdrew a dime. The coin rolled down its chute clicking like a pinball. Rosa turned.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>Who can say what is love? Can you? You cannot. Sure, da gama styles creativity's glow: I cannot prove that love exists but reason gives me the word to name the feeling and I have faith that that feeling is true. Conti didn't think of poetic bullshit like that. Conti thought how lovely and fresh Rosa looked. Smooth pink skin perspiry with the blush of youth on fair cheek that pleases mothers and excites men, Conti felt urge to whistle. Romeo Dandy, Latin satyr, in school boy Italian Conti softy whispered to be heard: Push with the thumb . . .  He pull out a plum . . .  Say, what a good boy am I . . .</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>Coldblooded, Conti was hot. Rosa smiled. Feint. Breathing maturely, she knew what she wanted. Rosa wanted what was looking right at her. Only the beginning of June, already so damned hot you ached to take your clothes off and bathe in cool waters.       In fifteen minutes Rosa was splashing in Conti's arms, Shangri-La's waters baptizing its new, young lovers. Innocent, hearts want what they want, consequences be damned. Once, Shangri-La held a beautiful pool. </p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "center", fontWeight : "600", paddingTop :"20px", paddingBottom : "20px"}} >≈</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>Klements was a kind, ugly man. Bad teeth, nicotine stained fingers, long ponytail; perpetual baseball hat, probably wears it in the shower; if he showers. Klements is Rosa's friend and her man. Sleeping soundly in her bed, Klements' sure hands gently turn a dreaming Rosa. Dreaming of fast cars, wind blows a tear across Rosa's face.   Grace Kelly? Girl, you have nothing on me . . .</p>

If you don't believe me, ask the man jumping from the World Trade Center rather than burn to death. Ask the wife and child left behind. For allowing it to happen, ask God himself. God is good. Ask the forty-thousand people perished in the 1500's Portuguese earthquake. Ask the dead in Darfur. Ask the little girl at knife-point to the rapist. If you still don't believe me, ask yourself. Yes, God is good. Ask Rosa. She'll tell you herself.</p>

                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>Twenty-four, seven years with Conti. No ring; but no sign of their love letting up, yet. Life is fairly delicious. Stylin' Rosa tutors young Ursuline Academy hopefuls on violin. Sneaking glances at little framed Polaroid’s of her and Conti laughing in a gorgeous, Lake Dallas speedboat, Rosa’s hopefuls admired her heroic mad pride girl reputation. If there was a city kid, like she was in Hamburg, Rosa shared her musical gifts freely. The few green bills she did earn, Rosa happily slid under her little German doll's dress. Contessa Marchessa! Party favors with Conti. Life is good! Yes, life is damned good.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "justify", textIndent : "20px"}}>  On Fridays, Conti would return. Happy eyes, it was always, Hi, Jew! Hi, Ger-man! Rosa was smart, beautiful, and hoping to bring a child to bear. Their child. Imagine it! Conti, our own little Italian-German! How sweet that will be! Conti constantly joked Baby, now we be rich! Trifecta! How fast little baby lose the next war? Rosa giggled. German-Italian, go figure.</p>

Never saw anything at all except the deep insides of Rosa's womb. That baby certainly never saw the pick-up truck coming. Of that, we are sure. Neither did Conti. As Rosa drove his new Buick Electra 225 down Northwest Highway heading east on an undivided median, the Mexican man wasn't looking. No one ever is, are they? Over the spinning of the wheel, the sharp snap of gravity's force, upended tires climbed a fender, crashing onto the hood, upward and straight through the Buick's shiny windshield. Rosa! Rosa. Rosa so loved to drive.</p>

Rectangular in shape, A-sloped roofing, vanilla brick, grey shingles and trim, cobalt blue doors. Surprisingly, the doors are each as uniquely painted as the resident’s personalities behind them. This is not by design. This is by over the years allowing various maintenance personnel and "painters" - mostly Shangri-La's thirsty residents - to beer barter tools and supplies necessary to repair and repaint failure and misgivings. A door slammed once too often; lock hinge broken off; peep hole gouged; a kick-plate kicked in; beaten hollow door; rain; swell; a freeze; a shrinkage; a lock-out; a lock-in; at one time or another every soul in Shangri-La experiencing love-hate relations with The Lady or The Tiger. Stunning, Shangri-La’s original cobalt de Kooning doors burn flamboyantly, tribute to existential lives led within. Shields. Shields of valor.</p>

Now it's 62 boxes of loneliness; shared kitchens and a bath. The poet coins the phrase: Evolvus o Morte. Evolve or die. Shangri-La has evolved, even if its mitochondrial DNA is a bit bent.

Catastrophically head-injured; for Rosa, memory is like a fading mist. Ephemeral, languorous, longing, it haunts; memory of a willow in a swamp.

Yet, even after all these years, its scar still burned tender to the touch of the group. "The Accident". There, I've said it again. And will have to say it, again, n' again; n' again; until it's no longer even a word or a phrase; it's a feeling living on inside long after the blood is lovingly wiped; the broken glass swept up; the twisted fenders hauled away; the streets hosed clean; the traffic lights turning green once again; allowing others, not Rosa, to get on with their lives. For Rosa, time is an eternal stillness. Faulkner's light in August, even on a cold winter's day. On with it! Enough! But it's never enough. And it never will be. It's always going to be there.

Unmarried, no insurance, drinking Compari that Rosa had so gaily bought for him - Rosa was so damned good to him and just like a man he quietly took her for granted. Conti, aroused in the moment, not thinking of immortality; Rosa, bending for his love, giving whenever asked - To hell with that rhythm method! - Conti wouldn't, couldn't stop thrusting her deep and deeper. Wailing the sweet wail, dearly clutching onto the sink, Rosa was creating new life. She loved it too, even, especially, when she learned she carried twins. That's the way it was: Twins.

Early thirties, firm flesh, easy smile; clean, delicate hands inviting Rosa's loving touch. Conti hated himself, almost, for stopping off in Tchopatoulas and banging the forty-something red head. He told himself This is what men do. A man, yes, this is what I do! The mossy, Louisiana bayou two lane was hot and the macadam was a burning mirage.  Conti sipped his iced tea and shot up to seventy-five. Rosa!  </p>

A turquoise linen two-piece, its brilliance color-matched Shangri-La's cool waters. Conti also brought Rosa the little German doll she had kept on their bed. Silly, really. Grown Rosa. Sexy woman. Lingerie with lederhosen. Rosa: Cuckoo fun! And Conti had always loved it. Out of Rosa's corner eye, the doll caught her attention. Look, Rosa! It's Contessa Marchessa! Smile? Conti held Marchessa like a school girl. He worked her as if she were real and alive, dancing, swaying her, moving her body like a graceful ballerina, miming her playing violin, hiking her skirt, now down with her sox, mussing her locks, flying her 'round the room with the utmost of manly ease.

Contessa Marchessa? Do you miss Rosa? Laughing, he shakes the doll's head No! Conti asks Contessa, do you want Rosa home right away? Conti shakes Contessa's head up and down. Working hard for the smile, hoping to evoke that famous Rosa laugh, Conti has Marchessa vomit and any other such silliness that he can imagine.  It's working! Yes! Conti thinks he sees faint light in Rosa's eyes. Light that was once there; fleeting, he's sure that it's there again. Rosa smiles. No giggle. Just a little smile. Crocodiles begin to stir. Turning, Rosa fades away. Conti is very still. Marchessa in hand, Conti imagines this moment as his future with Rosa. Once the recipient of her admiration, now, Conti is invisible. He begins to cry. Soft, quiet tears. Mortal, a man, he can shoulder neither their weight nor burden. Controlled by the Gods, Conti sobs. </p>

At least not in this lifetime. Crazy. Not seeing Rosa again was the furthest thing from Conti's mind. Really. What man would teach his girl to drive, give her his hot, new car, and then, after "The Accident", leave her, his girl, alone and shattered in a hospital bed? Yes, what man would do that? Conti?  No good man would do that. Right? Brushing past the hanging turquoise dress, Conti did not look back.</p>

The perimeters of inevitability always make clear its points. Running cuts long sting, often needing years to salve.

First, it was about her scholarship. The letter from Sister Mary Frances came as a shock to Marie. She could not bring herself to share it with Hermann, or the girls. Marie suffered in silence. Finally, the few, small words burned her so bad Marie could no longer endure her grief alone. Sister Mary Frances wrote:</p>

Neither Hermann, nor Mitzi and Janelle, none of us have travelled outside Germany. Once, we took the summer train to The Cliffs of L'Havre. Herr, Father . . . What should we do? </p>

Silently, Rosa's little sisters were jealous. With each of Sister Mary Frances' intermittent letters - and each of Marie's pained reflections as a failing mother - solace crept further away.</p>

Marie had openly harbored hopes that Rosa would attend a nice East coast college. Meet and marry a clean cut, white shirt wearing, smart businessman, perhaps even an investment banker. Then, she would play music in a symphony. Husband would take care of Rosa in a way that Hermann was never able to; a point Marie did not begrudge. Hermann was an honest, hard working man and Marie respected and admired him. Good for her. It made the suffering years all the more worth it. Why, Rosa? Why?</p>

I head upstairs to my studio, knowing that if I don't finish filling out my unemployment form, I'll have no food to eat, no place to stay, no dream to dream. A babe grown dull. Damn. My spirit blackens. Thanks, Buddha.</p>

Sixty-four, he drives down Gaston Ave. to Baylor Hospital. None of this was his idea. It was Martha's. Martha, the single woman he had met at the Dallas Unitarian Church. Church. Conti. Now that's a laugh. But he told himself it was all right. He had read the slim little volume Martha had given to him and in just a few words it told him that while there may not be a God that anyone can ever prove or disprove, there is always life and it is good and worth honoring, and that people are good in-of-themselves, and so forth, and so on. Inspiration lent Conti hope.</p>

Too old, too tired, too un-cool to project the hipness image that the new style manufacturers were looking for. Admitted alcoholic, Conti peered deep into the red Compari bottle. Seeking its respite, no matter how much he drank, respite did not find him.</p>

He did not believe her. He no longer then believed in much at all. How can I?        Two failed marriages. No children. Two step-children whom he loved so dearly it made them feel uncomfortable. He insisted they call him Dad, not Conti. When the boy, Optimus, didn't, he would look him in the eye and with all the intensity that only a childless man can muster, he asked Don’t you love me like a Dad as much as I love you like a Son? Empathy was the answer Conti was looking for. One of the many. Optimus, young man-to-be, remembered Conti with style and class. Conti gave him cash to go on dates, his favorite cigarette lighter to impress the girls; and, for damned sure, they had genuinely enjoyed shooting pool together. I owe him. Just say it! Dad. </p>

So kind, others will be blinded by your kindness. A few, moved to even improve their lives in somehow hoping to honor her courage and continued faith. When Optimus racked up fifteen thousand dollars on her charge card in what turned out to be a still-born effort to launch a new musical, Martha did not anger aloud. Money she didn't have to lose, she shut down the card, wrote out an IOU and gently insisted the poet sign it. He did, too. And that was that, the poet forever burnished by Martha's good graces.</p>

Kill me God, I ain’t worth the price. Conti blinked hard. But wait! Wait!

                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left", fontWeight : "bolder"}}>Who do you most wish would read your book?</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left"}}>Do they read it and like it? Or do they just read it? That’s a hard question to answer, because I’ve already been gobsmacked by the people who have said nice things to me about it. Ann Patchett—my hero, my sister—is a toughie, and one of the things that I love about her is that she gives it to you straight. She is not nice just to be nice, and when she told me she loved the book, that meant the world to me. But okay, I’m avoiding this question, I’m going to try to just answer it honestly: If I knew they would enjoy it at least to some degree, here is a collection of geniuses I would love to read it: Ina Garten, Catherine Keener, Jenna Wortham and Welsey Morris, Parul Sehgal, Emmylou Harris, Lily Tomlin, Stevie Nicks, Barack Obama… I could do this all day, come to think of it.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left", fontWeight : "bolder"}}>What time of day do you write?</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left"}}>Right now, I’m only able to write—by which I mean answer emails and such—after my children are asleep. I know a lot of people write at night, and I know a lot of stay-at-home parents have written gorgeous novels in those precious hours, but I am so fully exhausted at 7 pm that I can barely respond to text messages. Pre-quarantine, I wrote two to three days a week between school drop-off and pick-up, so, say, between 9 am-2:45 pm. It’s not a lot, but it’s enough, and I miss it. I know everything will be different when we’re through this, and one of the ways that it will be different for me is that I will never again take a moment of childcare for granted. Not that I’ll be working every second! Taking a morning off work to go to the movies—god, what a truly blissful thought, can you imagine how restorative that would be?</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left", fontWeight : "bolder"}}>Which non-literary piece of culture—film, tv show, painting, song—could you not imagine your life without?</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left"}}>The Magnetic Fields have been a part of my life for the last twenty years, a neat half of my life. I just wrote a long essay about my friendship with Stephin Merritt, the songwriter and musician, and so they are on my mind, but I think that this would be my answer anyway. They are the band whose catalogue I know best—backwards and forwards, every single record—and who I have seen live the most, by an enormous margin. There  are other things that I have loved so deeply that they are a part of my neural pathways forever—The New Kids on the Block, Beverly Hills, 90210, high school movies from Rebel Without a Cause to Lara Jean, Pet Sounds, What’s the 411?, Lynda Barry’s cartoons—but I think on a daily basis, it’s The Magnetic Fields I can’t imagine my life without. I sing one of their songs to my children every night.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left", fontWeight : "bolder"}}>What was the first book you fell in love with?</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left"}}>Ferdinand was the first book I can remember seeing myself in—I’d still rather sit under a tree and smell flowers. Nancy Drew books, The Babysitter’s Club—those books that I could inhale, I loved those. When I got to 7th, 8th, 9th grade, though, whew, that’s when I started reading poetry. Any poetry I could find in my house, which was a lot. Edna St. Vincent Millay—god, isn’t it amazing that she’s one of the poets that is foisted on children first? If you haven’t, you must read Savage Beauty, her biography. Frank O’Hara, Allen Ginsberg! That put a spring in my hormonal little heart. But what’s wonderful about life, of course, and being a reader, is that there are always more books to set your heart aflame.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left", fontWeight : "bolder"}}>Name a classic you feel guilty about never having read?</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left"}}>There are plenty of things to feel guilty about in life—yelling at your kid, not putting a shopping cart back in the parking lot, sleeping with your best friend’s spouse—why put that on reading? If I could absolve readers of one thing, it would be this—feeling guilt about books that they like, and books that they don’t. Honestly, the only feeling that people should have about books they haven’t read yet is HOPE! There are so many classics I haven’t read—A Hundred Years of Solitude, Moby Dick, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn—and lucky me. I think the idea that you’re supposed to have already read everything—at what age? 20?—is not only unrealistic, but also kind of dopey! I was a dope at 20. I was a dope who read Anna Karenina, sure, but when I reread Anna Karenina at age 35, I got a lot more out of it.
I think that I’m getting better as a reader as I age, and so while I think there are certain books that I loved as a teen—the novels of Jack Kerouac, say—that I don’t think I would enjoy so heartily now. But as a 15-year-old? Zing! Just like every book is not for every person, and every reader is not for every book, I think different books are the right book at different moments for each of us. So ditch the pressure! Ditch the guilt! Embrace excitement, and glee, about all the books you still have to read for the very first time.</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left", fontWeight : "bolder"}}>Is there a book you wish you had written?</p>
                            <p className="lead" style = {{textAlign : "left"}}>Jennifer Egan’s A Visit from the Goon Squad. Man oh man, I love that book. Formally kooky, emotionally true, hilarious, wild. I’m going to read that again once I finish the book I’m reading now. What a truly, truly cool-ass book. I think it’s my choice because it has enough in common with my books—lots of voices, lots of characters, love over time—to feel like it’s within the realm of almost almost almost possibility, that if I got hit by a bolt of lightning, I could do it. (I couldn’t, of course, but a girl can dream.) And Pride and Prejudice. Because it’s fucking Pride and Prejudice.</p>
